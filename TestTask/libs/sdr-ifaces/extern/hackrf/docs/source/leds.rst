LEDs
====

When HackRF One is plugged in to a USB host, four LEDs should turn on: 3V3, 1V8, RF, and USB. The 3V3 LED indicates that the primary internal power supply is working properly. The 1V8 and RF LEDs indicate that firmware is running and has switched on additional internal power supplies. The USB LED indicates that the HackRF One is communicating with the host over USB.

The RX and TX LEDs indicate that a receive or transmit operation is currently in progress.

Each LED is a single color. There are no multi-colored LEDs on HackRF One. Adjacent LEDs are different colors in order to make them easier to distinguish from one another. The colors do not mean anything.
